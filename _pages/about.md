I am a Ph.D. statistician with postdoctoral training, academic experience as a professor, and twelve years as a statistician in RAND Corporation’s Pittsburgh office. My work blends methodological innovation with collaborative applied research, supported by a strong track record of extramural funding—including independent NIH and NSF awards—as well as approximately 50 peer-reviewed journal articles and another 50 RAND technical reports. 

My research spans causal inference, missing data methods (including development of the <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gerbil/index.html'>gerbil</a> R package), data fusion, survey design and weighting, and time series analysis, along with extensive interdisciplinary collaborations in the health and biomedical sciences as well as homeland security and defense. I also created the <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microsynth/index.html'>microsynth</a> R package for spatiotemporal causal inference and have led multiple large, complex research teams. Teaching and mentorship have been integral throughout my career
